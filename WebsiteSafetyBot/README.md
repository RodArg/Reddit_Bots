**What This Bot Does:

Hello, WebSafetyBot is a neat Reddit bot that can make sure the links you find while browsing
on Reddit are clean. 

The bot uses the Google Safe Browsing API v4 to check how safe websites are.
*(info: https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/)

You can call the bot with the command 
`!Facecheck <insert url>`

The bot will then reply to your comment and let you know whether the site you gave it
is safe or not. You'll also get a nice gif response!

Let me know if you have any questions about the code or if the bot isn't working properly.
